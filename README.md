# Small Unity Games

## Wii

This is a game using the Wii Remote using this API - https://github.com/Flafla2/Unity-Wiimote/releases/tag/v1.1

This game is very buggy and only currently allows to control the Wii Remote's lights and requires the Wii Remote to be reset after using, this was mainly to have a look around at the Wii Remote and just have fun playing with it

## Mobile

I wanted to test out and see how AR Games worked, I used Unity to develop a tester game for Android Mobile only, to play. You wait until you see grey panels and tap to play a cube, then you can give the cube treats by swiping up to give him spheres.

## PC

### Survival-Horror-Game

This was the first time I tested out NavMesh, it's a slenderman-esque game where you collect spheres and avoid being caught by the enemy
