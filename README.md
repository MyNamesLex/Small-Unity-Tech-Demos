# Small Unity Games

(This repo only involves use of the Unity Game Engine using the C# language)

## Wii

This is a game using the Wii Remote using this API - https://github.com/Flafla2/Unity-Wiimote/releases/tag/v1.1

This game is very buggy and only currently allows to control the Wii Remote's lights and requires the Wii Remote to be reset after using, this was mainly to have a look around at the Wii Remote and just have fun playing with it

## Mobile

I wanted to test out and see how AR Games worked, I used Unity to develop a tester game for Android Mobile only, to play. You wait until you see grey panels and tap to play a cube, then you can give the cube treats by swiping up to give him spheres.

## PC

### Player-Controller

This is a player controller I made during my spare time for fun. It contains the following features. Coyote Jump, Jump Buffer, Slide, Crouch, Wall Running, Jump, Pistol, Shotgun and Knife Mechanics, First Person Camera Controller, Ground Slam, Upwards and Downwards gravity. On the more programming side it features a finite state machine to help with ease of development
