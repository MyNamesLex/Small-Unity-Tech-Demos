# Small Unity Games

## Wii

This is a game using the Wii Remote using this API - https://github.com/Flafla2/Unity-Wiimote/releases/tag/v1.1

This game is very buggy and only currently allows to control the Wii Remote's lights and requires the Wii Remote to be reset after using, this was mainly to have a look around at the Wii Remote and just have fun playing with it

## Mobile

I wanted to test out and see how AR Games worked, I used Unity to develop a tester game for Android Mobile only, to play. You wait until you see grey panels and tap to play a cube, then you can give the cube treats by swiping up to give him spheres.

## PC

### Survival-Horror-Game

This was the first time I tested out NavMesh, it's a slenderman-esque game where you collect spheres and avoid being caught by the enemy

### Procedural-Generation

I wanted to try out procedural generation so I followed a Brackeys Tutorial and made this, I used the terrain component to geenrate the terrain and an offset command to give it a wave sort of look to it. Then i used perlin noise to generate a heightmap with the given width, height and scale of how large i want the map to be

### Mesh-Generation

Different type of terrain generation where I generate the mesh in code and then generate the terrain using vertices and traingles for the mesh and then use perlin noise to generate the height, i also added in a ienumerator for generating the mesh so it has a cool wave effect to it. I followed a Brackeys Tutorial to make all this.
